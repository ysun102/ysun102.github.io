    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">ABOUT PAWS AND RELAX</span></h5>
    <p>A really common problem for people working in mobile, solitary environments, is that they may have difficulties with productivity and stress management. If people are in a work from home environment especially, it can be difficult to delineate a work-life balance and end up getting caught in work instead, which may lead to additional stress and feelings of burn-out, harming one's mental health and productivity.</p>
    <p>As such, our solution was a system that could address both issues of productivity and wellbeing along with desires of companionship in the form of a productivity pal, which we have affectionately named Slinky, which hugs the user from behind around their neck while they work and vibrates when it detects stress from the user. We believe that the use of a stuffed animal as a tangible user interface encourages interactions with it similar to that of an pet or animal companion, which in turn will reduce feelings of isolation, and simultaneously, its function as a tangible user interface in stress detection and vibration will serve as a comforting, non-obtrusive reminder for the user to relax and take breaks so as to maintain productivity and avoid stress and burn-out.</p>
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">INTENDED AUDIENCE + MAIN TASKS</span></h5>
    <p>We split our intended users into three categories.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Work from home professionals:</b> Work from home professionals often feel most acutely the struggles of taking a break, as their work-life balance can be interrupted by the fact that their place of living is also their place of work. As such, the productivity pal can serve as a reminder for them to take a break and also serve as a companion if they're living alone.</li>
        <li><b>Students:</b> Heavy academic workload can often lead to burnout and stress. Students can also struggle with physically juggling when to work and when to take a break, as being a student isn't something that has a defined work schedule or 9-5.</li>
        <li><b>Long-distance drivers:</b> We also wanted to focus on our system's uses on keeping long-distance drivers alert but simultaneously relaxed with the soothing vibrations from the plushie. In addition, the plushie can also serve as an affectionate companion during a long, lonely drive.</li>
    </ol>
